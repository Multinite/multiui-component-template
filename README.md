### This is an official starter template for creating a component for MultiUI.

## 🤔 What's inside

This project is a simple TurboRepo project containing the following folders:

- `packages/component`: Contains the source code for your component.
- `apps/demo-app`: Contains the source code for a NextJS demo app to render your component.

<br />

## ⭐️ How do I get started?

We recommend you read our documentation on creating a component for MultiUI:
https://multiui.org/docs/components/create-component

To get started, follow these steps:
1. install the dependencies:
```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Start development:
```sh
pnpm dev
```

There should be two instances running:

- NextJS dev server.
- TypeScript dev server watching your component.

You can now edit your component in the `packages/component/src` folder and see the changes in your browser.
